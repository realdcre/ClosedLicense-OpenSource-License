This encourages learning, innovation, and collaboration among users who wish to explore the capabilities of the code.

    Modification: You are permitted to modify the code to suit your specific needs. However, any modifications you make must also remain available for personal use under this license. If you choose to alter the code, you are required to commit those modifications to this repository or a fork of it. This ensures that improvements and enhancements are shared within the community, fostering a collaborative environment where users can benefit from each other's contributions while maintaining the integrity of the original work.

    Commercial Use: Commercial use of the code in this repository is strictly prohibited unless a separate contract has been established with the creator of this repository. If you are interested in utilizing the code for commercial purposes—such as incorporating it into a product, service, or application that generates revenue—you must obtain explicit permission from the creator. This provision is designed to protect the creator's rights and allow them to monetize their work, ensuring that they can benefit from their intellectual property while still permitting open-source distribution for personal use.

    Attribution: If you distribute modified or unmodified versions of this code, you must include this license text and provide appropriate credit to the creator. This is crucial for acknowledging the original work and the effort that went into its creation. The distribution of unmodified contents is only allowed as a fork or with VISIBLE credit attribution. If you distribute modified contents, you are allowed to do so as a fork, but you must still provide proper attribution. This requirement promotes transparency and respect within the open-source community.

    Disclaimer: The code in this repository is provided "as is," without any warranties or guarantees. The creator is not liable for any damages resulting from the use of this code. It is essential to understand that you use the code at your own risk, and you should proceed with caution, especially if you are integrating it into larger projects or systems. Users are encouraged to thoroughly test and evaluate the code before deploying it in any critical applications.

    Monetization: You are not allowed to monetize this project in any form. Only the ORIGINAL and FULLY ATTRIBUTED creator is permitted to enter into sales or distribution contracts related to the code. This means that you cannot sell, license, or otherwise profit from the code or any derivative works without explicit permission from the creator. This provision is intended to ensure that the creator retains the ability to monetize their work while allowing others to use and share it for personal and educational purposes.

    Scope of Use: This license is intended to facilitate the open-source distribution of code for private individuals, allowing them to learn, experiment, and innovate without the burden of commercial restrictions. However, it also establishes clear boundaries regarding commercial use, ensuring that the creator's rights are protected. This balance aims to foster a vibrant community of users while respecting the intellectual property of the creator.
