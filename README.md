# ClosedLicense-OpenSource-License
This is the home of the Closed License Open Source Project. A Licensing system that allows private persons to use your code for free, but charge any commercial party for doing so, whilst you can earn money for contributing to open source.


## Overview
Welcome to the ClosedLicense-OpenSource repository! This project is designed to foster personal use, modification, and educational distribution of the code while protecting the creator's rights. This README provides an overview of the license's goals and properties, as well as guidelines for using and contributing to the project.

## License Goals
The ClosedLicense-OpenSource License aims to:


- **Encourage Learning and Innovation**: By allowing users to freely use and modify the code for personal, non-commercial purposes, we promote exploration and experimentation.

- **Foster Community Collaboration**: Users are encouraged to share their modifications and improvements, contributing to a collaborative environment that benefits everyone.

- **Protect Creator Rights**: The license establishes clear boundaries regarding commercial use, ensuring that the creator retains the ability to monetize their work while allowing open-source distribution for personal use.

## Key Properties of the License


1. **Personal Use**: Users can freely use, modify, and distribute the code for personal, non-commercial purposes. This encourages individual learning and experimentation.


2. **Modification and Sharing**: Users are permitted to modify the code to suit their needs. However, any modifications must also be shared under the same license, ensuring that improvements benefit the community.


3. **Attribution Requirement**: When distributing the code, whether modified or unmodified, users must include the license text and provide appropriate credit to the original creator. This promotes transparency and respect for the original work.


4. **Commercial Use Restrictions**: Commercial use of the code is strictly prohibited unless a separate agreement is established with the creator. This protects the creator's rights and allows them to monetize their work.


5. **Educational Use**: The license allows for the distribution and modification of the code for educational purposes, provided that proper credit is given to the original creator and a licensing agreement is made with educational institutions.


6. **Special Grants**: The creator reserves the right to issue special grants that may provide additional permissions or exemptions from standard terms. Interested parties can request these grants by contacting the creator directly.

## Use it Yourself

You are encouraged to use the ClosedLicense-OpenSource License for your own projects! We offer both **Core** and **Extended** versions of the license to suit different needs. The Core version provides essential rights for personal use and modification, while the Extended version includes additional provisions for educational and community engagement. 

Feel free to customize and modify the license to better fit your specific requirements. For detailed guidance on how to adapt the license to your needs, please refer to the "How to License.md" document included in this repository. This flexibility allows you to create a licensing framework that aligns with your project's goals while respecting the rights of the original creator.
